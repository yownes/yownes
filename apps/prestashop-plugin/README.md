**PrestaShop** is an efficient and innovative e-commerce solution with all the features you need to create an online store and grow your business.

**CMS Connect App** - adds the connection between the PrestaShop CMS and Yownes Web App via a GraphQL API.

## What does it do?

This is a PrestaShop module that connects the PrestaShop CMS with the Yownes Web App via a GraphQL API. When installed, you will be provided with a CMS Connect URL that you will add to your Yownes Web App during App setup.

### PrestaShop Blog (PrestaBlog)

Since PrestaShop does not have a built-in Blog, we use [PrestaBlog](https://addons.prestashop.com/en/blog-forum-new/4731-professional-blog.html) to add blog support. If PrestaBlog is not avalible, Yownes will ignore it.

## How to install?

Php version required >= 5.5, <= 7.2 (this limitation will be removed in the future)

### Quick Install

1. The quickest way to install is via PrestaShop Module Manager or manually [Download](https://github.com/yownes/yownes) the **compiled** module and upload it through the 'Modules > Module Manager > Upload a module' menu in PrestaShop
2. Activate the Module after installation is complete
3. Visit modules's configurations to get the CMS Connect URL

You will need the CMS Connect URL to complete the Yownes App installation.
